# LectureLab

A personal, local-first study app. It records Zoom lectures (or imports recordings), transcribes
them, and turns them into study material organised by subject: summaries, notes, flashcards,
exercises and exam questions, each linked back to the exact moment in the lecture.

> Status: Phase 1 in progress. See [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).

## Setup (Windows)

Requirements: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node.js 20+, and ffmpeg on `PATH`
(`winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`).

```powershell
git clone <this repo>; cd <repo>
uv sync                         # creates .venv with Python 3.12
.\start.ps1                     # builds the frontend on first run, starts the app, opens the browser
```

Optional, to pre-create this semester's subjects:

```powershell
uv run lecturelab seed-subjects scripts\subjects_ws2026.json
```

The app listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8765` only. Data is stored in `%USERPROFILE%\LectureLab`
(change with `LECTURELAB_DATA_DIR` or `--data-dir`); settings are in `config.toml` there.

## Development

```powershell
uv run pytest; uv run ruff check .
cd frontend; npm run dev        # hot-reloading UI on :5173 (run the backend separately)
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the folder map and conventions.

## Privacy

Recordings never leave your machine. The server binds to `127.0.0.1`. Only LLM API calls go out,
and none when Ollama is selected. Recording lectures may need the lecturer's permission.
